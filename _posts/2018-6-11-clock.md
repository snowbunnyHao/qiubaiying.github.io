exercise 2:
Wearable personal health monitoring systems need to provide both highly accurate, secured and quick processing and delivery of vast amount of data.

Wearable personal health monitoring systems offers a cost effective solution for human healthcare. These systems must provide both highly accurate, secured and quick processing and delivery of vast amount of data. In addition, wearable biomedical devices are used in inpatient, outpatient, and at home e-Patient care that must constantly monitor the patient’s biomedical and physiological signals 24/7. Most previous works have focused on modifications to existing microcontrollers/processors by reducing the instruction set architecture (ISA) or creating an SoC with specialized accelerator cores targeted for particular biomedical applications. These approaches are often very expensive and require long development time to develop specialized chips. Furthermore, these modifications do not target the fundamental characteristics in-common with a majority of biomedical applications. This article propose a low-power, domain-specific manycore accelerator named Power Ecient Nano Clusters (PENC). This manycore architecture is ideally suited for most biomedical applications as it addresses the inherent characteristics and challenges. By using the optimal number of cores with DVFS, the PENC manycore was able to reduce energy usage by up to 80% and 14% for DSP and ML tasks, respectively, relative to using the minimal number of cores. When compared to other commercial o-the-shelf platforms for the case study of seizure detection, the PENC manycore is able to reduce energy by up to 10X while having comparable execution time. From the experimental results, manycore accelerator architecture is adapted to Biomedical applications data which contain various digital signal processing and machine learning kernels.
