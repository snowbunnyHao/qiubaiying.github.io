Online course:
1 verb change:
phrasal verb & prepositional verb   ->  single verb forms

2 formal expression:
eg: for just about -> for nearly/approximately
has been a lot of -> has been considerable
got obvious -> we obtained visible

3 adverb:
informal: 放前面或者后面
formal：放中间

4 tense:
past tense: your result
present tense: concluding assessment of results

5 voice:
active voice:
passive voice: 在methods中用的比较多

6 run-on expressions:
so on  ->  including
etc    ->  and other ...
and so forth  ->  and similar

7 contrations:
won't -> will not
didn't -> did not
couldn't -> could not

avoid apostrophes altogether

可以改为negative form

8 pronouns
I -> we/our
you -> the result can be seen(passive voice)

9 questions
what/why/does... 尽量避免

10 economic use
精简用词

Class:
1 that:
很多句子去掉that后还是一个完整的句子

indicative(used in figures/tables 接词语) & informative(for conclusion)
informative(conclusion):demonstrate that, suggest that, indicate that后接完整的句子

2. overuse of can/could/would/should
could, can -> is approximately to, is able to...(can代表有概率的事件)
尽量避免类似的用法，引起歧义
suggest,show已经表明了这样的意思，可以在这样的词汇上进行修饰(strongly...)

3 number mismatch verb/noun

4 tense and voice
introduction section: present tense
result section: past tense
conclusion section: present tense

在同一句话中past present混用也是有可能的

A/I/R/D: active voice
Method: 一般用passive voice

5 adverbs:
副词跟在动词旁边避免歧义
使用合适的副词
不要用obviously

6 contraction:
把... not 转换成一个词

7 question
direct question转换为indirect question
... whether ....how...

has -> whether

8 other
as we all know 不要用
不要用you 用we
不要用some
避免使用there is/are/were

9 run-on
and so on...（避免）-> including...
注意including的用法: including表明选择了其中的某几种,如果要列举用namely
