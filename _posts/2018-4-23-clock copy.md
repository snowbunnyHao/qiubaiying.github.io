Writing:
1.Analysis
express your analysis with clarity, simplicity, precision, logic.(by reading with focus on grammer,style,organization) 
2.Form

Acdemic writing aim: let everyone konw what you want to say.


writing fundamental principles:
1. style
2. organizaition:
problem-solution, general specific
3. audience & story

Problem:
1. use of nouns instead of verbs
大量的abstract nouns会影响可读性
尽量把名词作为动词来使用。

2.use of informal verbs
1)informal -> formal: get -> obtain
2)phrasal verb(两个单词的)转换为single verb forms(eg. keep up->maintain)
3)名词动词不搭配
可以查找verb table,往期文章

3 use of verb not suitable in the context

4.use of prepositions instead of proper verb
with -> using

5 use of lazy verbs(to do, to have, to be)
is -> contains

6 use of verbs without that
